# 👋 Hi, This is Arthur (chgwyellow)

I enjoy immersing myself in the world of programming — exploring data, building systems, and creating things that actually work.  
My goal is to grow into someone who can turn ideas into scalable and reliable data solutions.

## 📂 Featured Project

### 🔹 **Machine Learning Model – Air Quality Prediction Model**

📌 **A predictive modeling project focused on forecasting Air Quality Index (AQI) using machine learning techniques.**  
This project demonstrates my ability to handle a full ML workflow — from data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis, to training models, evaluating performance, and generating interpretable insights.
